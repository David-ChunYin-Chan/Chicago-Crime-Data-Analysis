# Chicago Crime Data Analysis

## Introduction
This project analyzes Chicago Crime Data (2001-2023), exploring temporal and geographic trends. Key findings include decreasing overall crime and arrest rates, a spike in domestic crimes during the pandemic, and the prevalence of property offenses. Seasonal and geographical variations, along with district-specific insights, are highlighted. Acknowledging data contributors, the project aims to provide valuable insights into Chicago's crime dynamics.
